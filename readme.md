With the below time pattern , we will solve all the questions , if we arent able to solve it within 1 hr , we shall see the solution . 

1Hr interview 

10 minutes requirement gathering , First 5 mins write your own requirements , Next 5 mins see the requirements of the problem statements 
next 30 to 45 minutes , design the whole solution 
remaining time code down the solution 



Step 1 : 

Identify the requirements
The first few minutes (usually around 10 minutes) of the interview are for you to understand the entirety of the problem. You should use this time to gather the system's requirements by asking the interviewer questions. 
It is easier to work on a solution if there is a well-defined requirement set. You should also ask the interviewer if they expect you to implement the solution fully or give a structural overview. 
Try to understand and apply the SOLID principle, which covers all the significant aspects of OOD (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism). 
It is important to know that the interviewer is looking for the following:

How good are you at collecting requirements?

Are you able to effectively scope down the problem?

Can you produce a design based on your requirements within the 30–45 minutes given to you?


Step 2 : 

Take - 30 to 45 minutes to design the solutions


Step 3 : 

Code the solution 
Choose which design approach to use Top-Down or Bottom-Up 


Top-down vs. bottom-up approach
The two most popular design approaches are top-down and bottom-up design. The table below highlights a few differences between the two:

Top-down

1. This approach constructs high-level objects, and then designs the smaller subcomponents.
2. It’s a backward-looking approach.
3. It’s mainly used in structural programming.
4. It allows for a high amount of data redundancy.

Bottom-up

1.This approach identifies the smallest components and uses those components as a base to design bigger components.
2.It’s a forward-looking approach.
3.It’s mainly used in object-oriented design.
4.It allows for a minimum data redundancy.

Since most of the problems in this course follow an object-oriented design, it is more suitable to follow the bottom-up design approach to develop them.

In interviews also we will go for bottom-up approach
